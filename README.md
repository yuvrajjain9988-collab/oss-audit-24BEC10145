# The Open Source Audit: [VLC Media Player]
### OSS NGMC Capstone Project | VITyarthi

##  Project Overview
This project is a structured audit of **VLC Media Player**, conducted as part of the Open Source Software (OSS) course. It explores the intersection of software philosophy, licensing ethics, and practical Linux systems administration.

[cite_start]The goal is to move beyond "what" the software does and investigate **why** it exists, **who** built it, and **how** it functions within the Linux ecosystem[cite: 13].

##  Repository Structure
* `/scripts`: Contains 5 functional Bash scripts demonstrating Linux automation.
* [cite_start]`/report`: The final 12-16 page PDF audit report[cite: 224].
* `README.md`: Project documentation.

##  Technical Implementation (Shell Scripts)
This repository includes five shell scripts designed to showcase command-line proficiency and automation:

1.  [cite_start]**System Identity Report**: Displays distribution info, kernel version, and licensing details[cite: 93].
2.  [cite_start]**FOSS Package Inspector**: Uses `rpm` or `dpkg` to audit the installation status and metadata of the software[cite: 125].
3.  [cite_start]**Disk & Permission Auditor**: A recursive directory auditor that reports on size and ownership[cite: 145].
4.  [cite_start]**Log File Analyzer**: A diagnostic tool that parses system logs for specific keywords like `ERROR` or `WARNING`[cite: 163].
5.  [cite_start]**Manifesto Generator**: An interactive script that generates a personalized philosophy statement[cite: 185].

##  Report Highlights
The accompanying report covers:
* [cite_start]**Origin & Philosophy**: The "problem-solution" history of the project[cite: 32].
* [cite_start]**License Audit**: Analysis of the four freedoms and legal constraints (e.g., GPL vs. MIT)[cite: 42, 45].
* [cite_start]**Linux Footprint**: Documentation of binary locations, config files, and service management[cite: 63].
* [cite_start]**Critical Analysis**: A head-to-head comparison with proprietary alternatives[cite: 80].

##  Getting Started
To run the scripts included in this project:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [Your-Repo-URL]`
2. Navigate to the scripts folder: `cd scripts`
3. Give execution permissions: `chmod +x *.sh`
4. Run a script: `./system_identity.sh`

##  License
This project is part of an academic audit. [cite_start]The software being audited retains its original license (e.g., GPL v2, Apache 2.0)[cite: 24].
